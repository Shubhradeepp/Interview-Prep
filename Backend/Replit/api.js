API stands for Application Programming Interface.

It's allow different software applications to communicate and exchange data with each other. Think of it as a bridge between two applications, enabling them to interact and share information in a structured way.


Interface can be thought of as a contract of service between two applications. This contract defines how the two communicate with each other using requests and responses


// Receive request: The API server receives the request from the client or web application.
// Process request: The API server processes the request based on the specified parameters and endpoints.
// Retrieve data: The API server retrieves the requested data.
// Perform operations: The API server performs the required operations, such as updating records or inserting new ones.
// Prepare response: The API server prepares the response to send back to the client.




Users -> Client -> API(The client initiates the requests via the APIs URI)  -> API call to the server -> Server  => Server intratec with dB  => with help of Database Driver(Mongoose) =>Return response to the server => returns the response to api(RESPONSE) -> Client receives the response


MongoDB driver: A MongoDB driver is a piece of software that allows a programming language (like Node.js) to communicate with a MongoDB database. It handles the low-level details of the connection and query execution.

Mongoose: A popular ODM (Object-Document Mapper) for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a more object-oriented interface for interacting with MongoDB, making it easier to work with MongoDB documents in Node.js applications.

The client initiates the requests via the APIs URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)
The API makes a call to the server after receiving the request
Then the server sends the response back to the API with the information
Finally, the API transfers the data to the client


//Real life

Amazon  => indigi/booking/API_key  (API) => [request for Booking To Indigo Server] => Server intract with DB => Sends response to server=>
=> The API carry thr response to the client(AMAZON);


//By that Indigo don't have to expose their db, and do the n=booking work from other application safely


//API is a standard way with which your front-end (web/mobile) stores/gets information for your application. Your front-end can/should not directly access database ever. Understand the purpose of front-end which is to just display the interface and should do minimal processing. All the application logic should be at your backend (API server) which is exposed to your frontend via API (GET, POST etc) calls. So to store an item in your database, you will write data storing logic in your backend, and expose an API end-point which when triggered will perform the storing operation. That API call should be used by your front-end to trigger the storing process. In this way your logic of storing/database or any other thing is not exposed, only the API URL is. The purpose of front-end is to be exposed whereas backend/database should never be exposed and used from front-end



Server-Side API Interaction with Databases

When a client sends an API request to a server, the server typically follows these steps to interact with the database and retrieve the requested data:

API Endpoint and Request Handling:
The API endpoint on the server receives the client's request, which contains information such as the desired action (e.g., "GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"), the target resource (e.g., "/users"), and any necessary parameters.
The server's API framework or routing mechanism parses the request, extracts the relevant information, and determines the appropriate action to take.

Database Connection:
If the API endpoint requires data from the database, the server establishes a connection to the database using the appropriate database driver and connection string. This connection allows the server to communicate with the database and execute queries.

Query Execution:
The server constructs a SQL query based on the information provided in the API request. This query specifies the data to be retrieved, any filtering or sorting criteria, and the desired format (e.g., JSON, XML).
The server then executes the query against the database using the established connection. The database processes the query and returns the requested data.

Data Retrieval and Processing:
The server receives the results of the database query and processes them as needed. This might involve converting the data to a suitable format (e.g., JSON), applying any necessary transformations or calculations, and handling potential errors or exceptions.

API Response:
Once the data has been processed, the server constructs an API response containing the requested data. The response typically includes a status code (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found) and the data in the desired format.
The server sends the response back to the client, completing the API interaction.




The API request itself does not directly interact with the database.

 It serves as a communication mechanism between the client and the server.

The server is responsible for handling the API request, establishing the database connection, executing the query, retrieving the data, and constructing the response.

The API framework or routing mechanism on the server plays a crucial role in managing the API endpoints and routing requests to the appropriate handlers.

The choice of database driver and connection string depends on the specific database system being used (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB).

Error handling and exception management are essential to ensure the API's reliability and robustness.
