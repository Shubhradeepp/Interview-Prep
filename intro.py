Hi, My name is Shubhradeep Maity

I recently completed my B.tech in computer science and engineering from Netaji Subhash Engineering College with an overall 8.9 cgpa.

Along with my degree i have learned multiple programming languages like C++, JavaScript also few web technologies like for frontend react and for Backend node js, express js.

Also i have done multiple projects and implemented the technologies in my projects, few of the noticeable are Ai chat bot, E-VOTING SYSTEM, meme stream app etc..


Talking about my professional journey 
I have done a few internships 
as a SDE intern with bluestock Fintech, as BACKEND engineer with aryabhata Technology, where i gained hands on experience on react, node js , express js,

Currently I'm working as a Full-Stack developer at SwingBell Labs, where i contribute to solving many real life problems, 
One of the significant ones is building a patient care app, where the patient can book an appointment online

Lastly I'm a curious person who believes in team work

Thankyou that's it from my side
